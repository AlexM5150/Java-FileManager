# Java-FileManager
This was a final project concluding a Java Course where I was tasked to create an old school file manager for Windows or Mac using the Java Swing Library. The Filemanger is complete with rename, copy, delete, and run functionality for files and creating a new window and cascading the existing windows is avalible for the windows settings. Running a file will open the default launcher of the operating system for that file. The Filemanager starts in the C: drive but can be switched to the other existing drives on the system. The avalible and used space of these drives is displayed at the bottom of each window.
